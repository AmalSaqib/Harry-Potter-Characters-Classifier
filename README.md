# Harry-Potter-Characters-Classifier

I wanted to do an end-to-end project regarding something that excites me. Of course I landed on Harry Potter.

I want to do everything from scratch; making the dataset, managing it, test different classifiers, everything on my own.

# Let's start!!

I want to cover at least the most important characters. Harry Potter has a lot of characters in it so I chose the main ones.

1) Harry Potter
2) Hermione Granger
3) Ron Weasley
4) Voldemort
5) Ginny Weasley
6) Fred Weasley
7) George Weasley
8) Sirius Black
9) Albus Dumbledore
10) Severus Snape
11) Minerva McGonagall
12) Rubeus Hagrid
13) Draco Malfoy
14) Luna Lovegood
15) Dobby
16) Neville Longbottom
17) Remus Lupin




# data_collection.py
This piece of code lets me save all the data I collected from the movies to one directory. When you run the code, the images get resized to my desired size and saved in the respective folders of the dataset.

# data_creation.py
This code is used to generate the csv files that the model will use.

# count.py
Just to keep track of how many images I have for each class
