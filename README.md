# Harry-Potter-Characters-Classifier

I wanted to do an end-to-end project regarding something that excites me. Of course I landed on Harry Potter.

I want to do everything from scratch; making the dataset, managing it, test different classifiers, everything on my own.

# Let's start!!

I want to cover at least the most important characters. Harry Potter has a lot of characters in it so I chose the main ones.

1) Harry Potter
2) Hermione Granger
3) Ron Weasley
4) Voldemort
5) Ginny Weasley
6) Fred Weasley
7) George Weasley
8) Sirius Black
9) Albus Dumbledore
10) Severus Snape
11) Minerva McGonagall
12) Rubeus Hagrid
13) Draco Malfoy
14) Luna Lovegood
15) Dobby
16) Neville Longbottom
17) Remus Lupin




# resize.py
I wrote this code to make my life easier. When I am collecting the data, I save all my images in one directory. This code then parses through all the files in this input directory and for every image it finds the respective folder to add the image in. First it resizes the image, it moves it to that character's folder in the train folder, and then it deletes it from the input directory.
